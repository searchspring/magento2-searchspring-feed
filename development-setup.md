# Magento Docker Setup
Pull the Bitnami docker-compose file from the bitnami/magento repo.
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/magento/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
```
* Note: If you want to be able to access your Magento setup externally, you must update the `docker-compose.yml` file with the appropriate `MAGENTO_HOST` value. This will likely be your public-facing IP address. See [Public Access](#public-access) after proceeding through the setup for information on exposing your server to the public internet.

To start your containers, simply run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Navigate to http://localhost/admin to check if it works. Default login credentials are:
```
Username: user
Password: bitnami1
```

# Development inside the Container

## Github setup

Once the container is up and running, get the magento container name by running:
```
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}"
```

* There should be at least 3 containers, one for magento, one for elasticsearch, and one for mariadb.

Log into the container by running the following, replacing `<magento_container_name>` with the name found through the command above:
```
docker exec -it <magento_container_name> /bin/bash
```

Once inside the container, install git and github CLI: 
```
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
apt update
apt install gh
apt install git
```

After these have installed, authenticate github by running: 
``` 
gh auth login 
```
* Note: You can authenticate through the web browser by opening the [github device login](https://github.com/login/device) page and entering the code provided by `gh auth login`.

## Using VSCode 
Install the [Remote-Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for vscode.

From the extension toolbar on the left side bar, click on `Remote Explorer` and find your magento container. You can find the name of the magento container in the output of the following:
```
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}"
```
Right click the container and select `Attach in New Window`. This should open a new VSCode window (on the Get Started page), remoted in to your container.

In the new window, open the file explorer from the left side bar. Click on `Open Folder` and navigate to the `/bitnami/magento` directory.


# Extensions setup
## SearchSpring_Feed Extension
To setup the SearchSpring_Feed extension, create the necessary directory structure:
```
cd /bitnami/magento
mkdir -p app/code/SearchSpring/Feed
```

Clone the SearchSpring_Feed repository into the directory that was just created:
```
git clone https://github.com/searchspring/magento2-searchspring-feed.git app/code/SearchSpring/Feed
```
* From here, either install other extensions or proceed to [Extension Installation](#extension-installation) 

---
## Extension Installation
Login as the web server user. 
```
su daemon -s /bin/bash
```

To setup the extensions in magento, first enable any installed extensions by running `php bin/magento module:enable <module_name>`, replacing `<module_name>` with the extension to be installed. For example:
```
php bin/magento module:enable SearchSpring_Feed;
```

Then complete the setup by running the following:
```
php bin/magento setup:upgrade;
php bin/magento setup:di:compile;
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f;
php bin/magento cache:flush;
```

At this point, the extensions should be running. You can verify this from inside the docker container by running: `php bin/magento module:status <module_name>`, replacing `<module_name>` with the installed extension. For example:
```
php bin/magento module:status SearchSpring_Feed
```

Confirm that magento is up and running by navigating to http://localhost/admin. 

* Note: If you are presented with an error or a blank screen, rerunning the setup commands again should clear things up. Not gonna say "rerun until it works," but maybe try that a few times.

# Public Access
In order to access the Magento setup externally, you must have completed the note in the [Magento Docker Setup](#magento-docker-setup). Additionally, as with anything public facing, there are some security implications with exposing ports to the internet; **it is recommended that you only keep the docker container and/or ports available when necessary.** 

* Note: the following instructions are general. How they'll be implemented is going to vary based on your router and network setup.

After editing the docker compose file with your host, you must forward some ports to your device from your router. This can typically be done from your router's control panel. Additionally, you will need to know your device's IP address.
* On macOS, your router IP and device IP can be found by navigating to `System Preferences -> Network -> Wi-Fi -> Advanced... -> TCP/IP`. The numbers you're looking for are `IPv4 Address` and `Router`.

You should be able to log into your router's control panel by navigating to the router's IP address in your browser. Once you've found and logged into your router's control panel, there should be a link somewhere (possibly under advanced settings) labeled "Port Forwarding" or "Application Forwarding."

The ports that must be forwarded to the IP address of the device running the Magento containers are:
* 80 TCP
* 8080 TCP
* 443 TCP/UDP

After saving these settings to your router, your Magento installation should be accessible to the public internet. Check by navigating to your external IP address. This address is most easily found by googling "What is my IP." You should be presented with your Magento store front.

An alternative quick and dirty approach is using Cloudfare's [cloudfared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/local/#set-up-a-tunnel-locally-cli-setup) to create a unique publicly accessible url that will proxy all requests to localhost.
```
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```
This generates a random subdomain on Cloudfare that points to localhost on port 3000. The url will appear in the terminal. 


# Troubleshooting

* Restarting the docker container is a relatively quick way to ensure your changes are live. This can be done through Docker Desktop or through VSCode. To restart through VSCode, navigate to `Remote Explorer` on the left side bar of the magento workspace, right click on the active magento container in `Dev Containers` and select `Stop Container`. This should open a series of three prompts: first stop the container, second reload the window, third start the container.

* It may be necessary to rebuild the extensions by running the following from the `/bitnami/magento` directory as the web server user:
```
su daemon -s /bin/bash

php bin/magento setup:upgrade;
php bin/magento setup:di:compile;
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f;
php bin/magento cache:flush;
```

* You can enable printing of the error call stack on an erroring page by running the following from the `/bitnami/magento` directory:
```
bin/magento deploy:mode:set developer
```
* For generating customer data, run the `customer_generator.py` script, providing a number of customers to generate. This should create a CSV file that can be uploaded to magento through the admin interface.
